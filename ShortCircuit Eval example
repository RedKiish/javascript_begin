let username = '';
let defaultName = username || 'Stranger';

console.log(defaultName); // Prints: Stranger

//Truthy and falsy evaluations open a world of shorthand possibilities!

//Say you have a website and want to take a userâ€™s username to make a personalized greeting. Sometimes, the user does not have an account, making the username variable falsy. 
//If you combine your knowledge of logical operators you can use a shorthand for the code above. In a boolean condition, JavaScript assigns the truthy value to a variable if you use the || operator in your assignment
// Because || or statements check the left-hand condition first, the variable defaultName will be assigned the actual value of username if it is truthy, and it will be assigned the value of 'Stranger' if username is falsy. This concept is also referred to as short-circuit evaluation.
